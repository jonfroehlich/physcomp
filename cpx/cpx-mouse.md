- Maybe A1 down, A5 up, A3 right, A7 left
  - Need mouse click for http://jacksonpollock.org/
  - https://freepong.org/ (has mouse option)
- Then use Tilt for left, right, up, down, and buttons for click
  - Show off with a basic mouse game
    - Start by exploring Google Earth 
    - Maybe put a airplane on controller and play: https://gamaverse.com/anti-virus-game/
  - https://thisissand.com/ (actually have a bottle filled with sand)
  - http://jacksonpollock.org/
  - Show off with p5js painter app?
  - https://freepong.org/ (has mouse option)
