<!-- Capacitive sensing technology works by measuring the change in capacitance (the ability of a system to store an electric charge) within its projected field due to the presence of a conductive object. See: https://www.rspinc.com/blog/contract-manufacturing/what-is-a-capacitive-touch-sensor-how-are-they-used/ -->

<!-- From Wikipedia:
"In electrical engineering, capacitive sensing (sometimes capacitance sensing) is a technology, based on capacitive coupling, that can detect and measure anything that is conductive or has a dielectric constant different from air. ...

Many types of sensors use capacitive sensing, including sensors to detect and measure proximity, pressure, humidity.

And you're surrounded by capacitive sensingâ€”it's how modern touchscreens and touchpads work as well" -->
